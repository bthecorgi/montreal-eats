# montreal-eats

### tl;dr; 
- Schwartz. Long line. People get cherry coke with it. If line is long, you can get take out. The FATTY CUT is the most delicious.
- Juliette and chcolat is fun if you go w your coworker
- And if you want foie gras and a sort of fancier meal... Au pied du cocoon (Anthony bourdon did an episode on it)
- Get bagels! 
- Poutine anywhere. But La Obanquise is open 24/7 and good grubby, late night food.

## Long version ..

Places I always hit up in Montreal... La Banquise, Juliet et Chocolat, Schwartz... and get bagels... and then fun to walk around old montreal, place des arts. always some fun festivals happening. but mainly it's to eat.

## Poutine
for the Rich - Au Pied de Cochon (if you like Foie Gras- overwhelmingly good) - http://www.restaurantaupieddecochon.ca/index_eng.html - 536 avenue Duluth Est, Montreal

Le Banquise - http://www.restolabanquise.com/ - 994, Rachel Est, Montréal - there's one at Rue Catherine, near Schwartz's too

## Montreal Smoked Meat
Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen - www.schwartzsdeli.com - 3895 St Laurent
-> There will be a line. You will probably wait about 30+ minutes. It's worth it. f you don't want to wait, skip the line and get take out and eat somewhere else. Get medium to fatty meat. And get a cherry cola :)

"Reuben's" - www.reubensdeli.com - 1116 rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest
it was okay... no Schwartz's


## For Dessert
Juliette et Chocolat - two locations:
1615 rue Saint-Denis, Montréal - these guys make their own chocolate. it smells wonderful like a little chocolatier factory.
377 avenue Laurier Ouest, Montréal - (514) 287-3555‎

## Bagels
Fairmount bagels are good. Moreso for bulk ordering (i.e. bring some home).

St. Viateur Café and Bagel -  Famous Montreal sesame seed bagels, and a fantastic breakfast joint. Located on Monkland Ave, 5 or 6 blocks west of the DeCarie, north side.

## Other details:
Right turns on a red light is illegal

Also, if you're driving, there is parking at the Eaton Centre for $7/24-hours if you need to drop your car in the city. http://en.parkopedia.ca/parking/underground/le_centre_eaton_de_montréal/montréal/ (not sure if it's still $7 now lol)

Great bixi bike culture. Lots of bike lanes. Get the bixi app that will show you closest bike docks with # of bikes left, etc. If your group is into it, biking around town is a great and cheap way to get around town (if you bike in half hour segments). It's fun and skips the hassle of driving. Read about how it works and check the fees @ https://montreal.bixi.com/ride-with-bixi/functioning luv it!

## Things to do
Montreal museum of fine arts - free admission on certain days
St.Joseph's Oratory is always a nice look up
Mont Royal (always been free admin and open to public). Need to drive here.
Notre dame basilica... tres belle. Might be a small cover fee here unless you go sunday morning for a french service ;)
-McGill Uni.
-Old Montreal (usually has lots of festivals) or Place des Arts might have something going on there

## Other Food
- Good Greek at La Caverne Grecque (105 RUE PRINCE-ARTHUR EST MONTRÉAL, QC)
- Santropol – fantastic sandwich place, very unusual combinations, great soup, artisan atmosphere (http://www.santropol.com/pages/rdirectory.html )
- Nightlife street @ rue berri and st catherines (bars, clubs, rests)

- The Upstairs – a fantastic bar. Great live jazz, cozy setting, kind of like an upscale student pub. (http://www.upstairsjazz.com/ )

- For drinks afterwards, Le Reservoir 9 Duluth East

Best shopping in town is along St. Laurent and St. Denis streets above Sherbrooke, and along Mont-Royal streets and of course, along st.catherines
